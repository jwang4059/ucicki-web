						<p>
							Collectively, the California-Nevada-Hawaii District supports three
							different organizations through our fundraising endeavors. These
							District Fundraising Initiatives (DFIs) are the Pediatric Trauma
							Program (PTP), the Kiwanis Family House (KFH), and the
							Environmental Defense Fund.
						</p>
						<p>
							Fundraising events are events that Circle K members attend to
							raise money for a variety of charitable programs. It is a great
							way to meet new people from all across the Circle K universe while
							helping a good cause!

								healthy and safe lives. Funds are directed towards promoting
								community outreach, assisting partner hospitals, and providing
								advanced medical training for doctors. Ultimately, the goal of

								for treatment or must accommodate for extended treatment
								periods. Funds raised for this cause help to provide additional
								resources and to provide convenient, restful, secure, and low
								cost temporary housing for these families so that they may
								support their loved ones."
